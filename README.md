# Generative-adversarial-networks
This is a very simple implement of GANs by PyTorch 1.7.1.

This code is modifies, adapts by PyTorch 1.71 based on the GANs implemented in [devneg](https://github.com/devnag/pytorch-generative-adversarial-networks). Moreover, I adds some comments to the original code and personal understandings of some code segments.

**Task goal:** 

The goal of this GANs is to generate a Gaussian normal distribution from a uniform distribution; The task goal can be visualize like this:

the network architecture of generator and discriminator:

**Result Show**:

The following lists the data distribution results generated by the generator G for every 500 epochs of training.

epochs = 0

epochs = 1000

epochs = 5000

If we visualize the process iteration training, the sample mean and variance of the data distribution generated by the generator can be seen that:

After a certain epochs, the samples mean and variance of the generated data **converge stably** to the initial value we set for the target data distribution. 

It means that our GANs trained successfully!
